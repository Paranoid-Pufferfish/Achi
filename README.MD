# Achi game in C raylib

NOTE :

Somehow, and for reasons i can't bother to explain, when playing a 6rounds match in PVA mode, while starting first. and
playing the following sequence:

5->4->6, the IA deliberately loses by playing the following moves : 9->8->I assume it was about to play 7, but the game
ends before that

Treat it as a cheatcode, as a debug move, backdoor, anything you want it to be!

## How to run :

Idk just google how to compile a `meson` project lol!
